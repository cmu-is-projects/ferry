      <h3>About ferry</h3>
      <p>ferry is a command-line tool rubygem for data migrations and manipulations, maintained as an open-source project by the students of <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/information-systems/">Carnegie Mellon's Information Systems department</a> (currently <a href="http://github.com/anthcor">Anthony Corletti</a> and <a href="http://github.com/loganwatanabe">Logan Watanabe</a>. The inspiration for ferry was kindled from collective internship experiences and from the growing prevalence of big data migration and manipulation challenges that companies, corporations, universities, and organizations face in today's information age.</p>
      <p>It's important to note that not only are technology companies facing these big data issues, but that with the rise of the information age, more and more data is circulated around us, bringing these challenges to organizations that do not employ their own technical staff to manage these problems. <strong>The objective of ferry is to streamline the process of dealing with these big data problems, by making your data work for you, by entering a simple command from your terminal.</strong></p>

      <h3>Community Interaction &amp; Engagement</h3>
      <p>We are proud to be acquainted with <a href="http://technology.customink.com">CustomInk Tech</a> for advice on ferry's developent for code review, user testing, and feature suggestions.</p>
      <p>Concerning the open-source community, ferry is set to be released as an <a href="http://github.com/cmu-is-projects/ferry">open-source project on GitHub</a> by the middle of the 2014 Fall semester.</p>
      <p>Our community goals entail;</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Having ferry included into a large production product, site, or system that is outside of ths IS department.</li>
          <li>Have ferry forked by multiple users once open-sourced.</li>
          <li>Continue to have the students of the Carnegie Mellon Information Systems department develop ferry in the future to provide lasting value and increase visibility of the CMU IS program in the professional and open-source community.</li>
        </ol>

      <h3>Documentation &amp; Support</h3>
      <p>The easiest way to get started with ferry is to check out the full documentation at <a href="http://github.com/cmu-is-projects/ferry">our GitHub repo</a> once open-sourced. A more comprehensive document API will be posted on this site once the gem has been polished enough to be open-sourced.
